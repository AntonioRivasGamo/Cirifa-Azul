* Pet Listings: Upload photos, add detailed information, and manage your adoption posts.
* Advanced Search Filters: Search by species, size, age, location, and more to find the most suitable pet.
* Social Features: Explore profiles, save favorites, and contact pet owners or shelters.
* Social Media–like Experience: A friendly, dynamic, community-driven interface.

### Project Goal
To modernize and simplify the pet adoption process by offering an intuitive, user-focused platform that encourages responsible adoption and strengthens the connection between pets and potential adopters.
